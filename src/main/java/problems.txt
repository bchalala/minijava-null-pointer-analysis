Ok.

Mapping such that Node n points to a NodeRecord nr

node records point to other node records. If you want to look up a value in the table, you then 

Compile function which takes the list of all nodes

Other possibility, which could be way fucking easier

Build mapping of nodes going to other nodes, can do this on the fly. Whenever you look something up in the table, you'd have to traverse the node mapping. This is a bit shitter to be perfectly fair. But I would have to modify way less stuff.

S0 -> S1 -> S2 -> S3 -> S4 -> S6
					 -> S5 -> S6

Can build this with a map! 

S0 (S0)
S1 (S0)
S2 (S1, L(S0))
S3 ()
