Potential problems:

A -> B
B -> C
C -> D
C -> E 
D -> F 
E -> F 



there needs to be a notion of a follows set
every record that gets added needs to have 

First check the context, then check the current. If not in a branch, commits to the context get pushed straight through to the npa


What if...

node n -> record set

record sets point to other record sets.
